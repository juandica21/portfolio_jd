                            My first experience in the ICT world has helped me get started in the sector and put into practice everything I learned in the CFGS. I've worked in a variety of areas, including web maintenance, web application development, database maintenance, and graphic design. It has also helped me improve my soft skills, working on team projects, and communication skills.
